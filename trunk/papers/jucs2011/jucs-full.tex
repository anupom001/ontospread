%----WSKS
% The present paper introduces the ONTOSPREAD framework for the development,
% configuration, customization and execution of the Spreading Activation
% technique over graph-based structures, more specifically over RDF graphs and ontologies 
% arising from the Semantic Web area. This technique has been used to
% the efficient exploration and querying of large and heterogeneous knowledge bases 
% based on semantic networks in the Information and Document Retrieval domains. 
% ONTOSPREAD implements the double process of activation and spreading of concepts in ontologies applying 
% different restrictions of the original model like weight degradation according to the distance or 
% others coming from the extension of this technique like the converging paths reward. 
% This technique provide a whole framework to ease the information access, 
% common required feature in the exploitation of the current Web of Data. Moreover,
% it is considered to be relevant to support the recommendation of concepts in different fields liked e-health,
% e-procurement or e-tourism with the objective of getting a set of ranked resources.
% Finally an evaluation methodology and two examples using ontologies from different domains
% are provided to validate the goodness, the improvement and the capabilities of this framework applied 
% to digital libraries.

% It is considered to be relevant to support the recommendation of concepts for tagging clinical records
% and to provide a tool for decision-support in clinical diagnosis.

The aim of this paper is to present an extensible framework for the Spreading Activation technique. This technique
is supported by the ONTOSPREAD framework enabling the development, configuration, customization and execution
of the Spreading Activation method on graph-based structures. It has been used for a long time to
the efficient exploration of knowledge bases built on semantic networks in Information and Document Retrieval domains. 
Now the emerging Web of Data and the sheer mass of information now available make it possible 
the deployment of new services and applications based on the reuse of existing vocabularies and datasets. 
A huge amount of this information is published using semantic web languages and formats such as RDF,  
implicit graph structures developed using W3C standard languages: RDF-Schema or OWL, but new flexible and scalable 
methods to create added-value services and exploit the data are required. That is why ONTOSPREAD is considered 
to be relevant in order to provide a new way to implement the double process of activation and spreading of concepts.  
in graph-based structures, more specifically to browse and rank resources in the Web of Data realm. 
The original constraints like weight degradation according to the distance are provided in combination with 
others coming from the extension of this technique like the converging paths reward. 
Finally an evaluation methodology and two examples using the well-known ontologies GALEN and SNOMED CT are presented to 
validate the goodness, the improvement and the capabilities of this technique applied to an specific 
domain like clinical decission support systems.
