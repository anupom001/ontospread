This work provides a configurable and extensible API to support the SA technique. It allows
the configuration of restrictions and their combination to get
the most accurate set of output concepts. One of the features that
turns SA to a widely accepted algorithm lies in its flexibility 
but some disadvantages are also presented: the adjusting and refinement of
the restrictions and the weights of the relations, the selection of the
degradation function or the establishment of reward functions. This API
minimizes these advantages with an extensible framework that can be
applied to different scenarios like digital libraries in particular
biomedicine, e-procurement, e-health, etc. providing enriched services
of annotation, searching or recommendation.

ONTOSPREAD API has been initially developed in BOPA~\cite{bopaEstonia} project that is
one of \textit{Semantic Web Use Cases and Case
Studies}\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/sweo/public/UseCases/CTIC/}}
collected by W3C. Currently it is being applied to the process of searching
public procurement notices in the ``10ders Information Services''\footnote{\url{http://rd.10ders.net}} project, partially funded by 
the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism (TSI-020100-2010-919)
