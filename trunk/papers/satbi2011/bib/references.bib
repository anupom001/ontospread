@article{Collins_Loftus_1975, title={A spreading activation theory of semantic processing}, volume={82}, 
url={http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/82/6/407}, 
abstractNote={Presents a spreading-activation theory of human semantic processing, which can be applied to a wide range of recent experimental results. The theory is based on M. R. Quilliantextquoterights (1967) theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several misconceptions concerning Quilliantextquoterights theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by E. F. Loftus, J. F. Juola and R. C. Atkinsontextquoterights (1971) multiple-category experiment, C. Conradtextquoterights (1972) sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by K. J. Holyoak and A. L. Glass (1975), L. J. Rips et al (1973), and E. Rosch (1973). The paper also provides a critique of the Rips et al model for categorization judgments.}, number={6}, journal={Psychological Review}, author={AM.

A key issue in this area is how to discover user's interest and behavior effectively. In this paper we investigate an approach to recommendation system based on user ontology and spreading activation model. Through combining the user ontology and spreading activation model, the capability of discovering of user's potential interests is enhanced. A prototype system is also developed base on this methodology.}",

  abstract = {The Semantic Desktop is a means to support users in Personal Information
	Management (PIM). It provides an excellent test bed for Semantic
	Web technology: resources (e. g., persons, projects, messages, documents)
	are distributed amongst multiple systems, ontologies are used to
	link and annotate them. Finding information is a core element in
	PIM. For the end user, the search interface has to be intuitive
	to use, natural language queries provide a simple mean to express
	requests. State of the art semantic search engines focus on fact
	retrieval or on semantic document retrieval. We combine both approaches
	to search the Semantic Desktop exploiting all available information.
	Our semantic search engine, built on semantic teleporting and spreading
	activation, is able to answer natural language queries with facts,
	e. g., a specific phone number, and/or relevant documents. We evaluated
	our approach on ESWC 2007 data in comparison with Google site search.}

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Computerized clinical decision support systems are information technology-based systems designed to improve clinical decision-making. As with any healthcare intervention with claims to improve process of care or patient outcomes, decision support systems should be rigorously evaluated before widespread dissemination into clinical practice. Engaging healthcare providers and managers in the review process may facilitate knowledge translation and uptake. The objective of this research was to form a partnership of healthcare providers, managers, and researchers to review randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of computerized decision support for six clinical application areas: primary preventive care, therapeutic drug monitoring and dosing, drug prescribing, chronic disease management, diagnostic test ordering and interpretation, and acute care management; and to identify study characteristics that predict {benefit.METHODS}:The review was undertaken by the Health Information Research Unit, {McMaster} University, in partnership with Hamilton Health Sciences, the Hamilton, Niagara, Haldimand, and Brant Local Health Integration Network, and pertinent healthcare service teams. Following agreement on information needs and interests with decision-makers, our earlier systematic review was updated by searching Medline, {EMBASE}, {EBM} Review databases, and Inspec, and reviewing reference lists through 6 January 2010. Data extraction items were expanded according to input from decision-makers. Authors of primary studies were contacted to confirm data and to provide additional information. Eligible trials were organized according to clinical area of application. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect on practitioner performance or patient outcomes of patient care provided with a computerized clinical decision support system compared with patient care without such a {system.RESULTS}:Data will be summarized using descriptive summary measures, including proportions for categorical variables and means for continuous variables. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models will be used to investigate associations between outcomes of interest and study specific covariates. When reporting results from individual studies, we will cite the measures of association and p-values reported in the studies. If appropriate for groups of studies with similar features, we will conduct {meta-analyses.CONCLUSION}:A decision-maker-researcher partnership provides a model for systematic reviews that may foster knowledge translation and uptake.},

@article{citeulike:7749740,
    abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To classify automatically lung tumor-node-metastases ({TNM}) cancer stages from free-text pathology reports using symbolic rule-based classification. {DESIGN}: By exploiting report substructure and the symbolic manipulation of systematized nomenclature of medicine-clinical terms ({SNOMED} {CT}) concepts in reports, statements in free text can be evaluated for relevance against factors relating to the staging guidelines. Post-coordinated {SNOMED} {CT} expressions based on templates were defined and populated by concepts in reports, and tested for subsumption by staging factors. The subsumption results were used to build logic according to the staging guidelines to calculate the {TNM} stage. {MEASUREMENTS}: The accuracy measure and confusion matrices were used to evaluate the {TNM} stages classified by the symbolic rule-based system. The system was evaluated against a database of multidisciplinary team staging decisions and a machine learning-based text classification system using support vector machines. {RESULTS}: Overall accuracy on a corpus of pathology reports for 718 lung cancer patients against a database of pathological {TNM} staging decisions were 72\%, 78\%, and 94\% for T, N, and M staging, respectively. The system's performance was also comparable to support vector machine classification approaches. {CONCLUSION}: A system to classify lung {TNM} stages from free-text pathology reports was developed, and it was verified that the symbolic rule-based approach using {SNOMED} {CT} can be used for the extraction of key lung cancer characteristics from free-text reports. Future work will investigate the applicability of using the proposed methodology for extracting other cancer characteristics and types.},
