Since SA was introduced by~\cite{Collins_Loftus_1975} in the field of 
psycho linguistics and semantic priming it has been applied to the resolution
of problems trying to simulate the behaviour of the brain using a connectionist method
to provide an ``intelligent'' way to retrieve information and data. 

The use of SA was motivated due to the research on graph exploration~\cite{Scott1981,AndersonTheory,Cohen1987}. Nevertheless
the sucess of this technique is specially relevant to the fields of Document~\cite{turtle91inference} 
and Information Retrieval~\cite{SpreadingActivationIR,Helmut2004,Agosti1993,Grinberg:2011:ASA:1940632.1940674}. It has
also been demonstrated its application to extract correlations between query terms and documents analyzing user 
logs~\cite{Cui03} and to retrieve resources amongst multiple systems~\cite{Schumacher+2008search} 
in which ontologies are used to link and annotate resoruces.

In recent years and regarding the emerging use of ontologies in the Semantic Web area new applications of SA have
appeared to explore concepts~\cite{Qiu93,Chen95} addressing the two important issues: 1) the selection and 2) the weighting of
additional search terms. On the other hand, there are works~\cite{DBLP:journals/cogsr/KatiforiVD10,DBLP:journals/ijsc/DixKLVS10} 
exploring the application of the SA on ontologies in order to create context inference models.The 
semi-automatically extension and refinement of ontologies~\cite{liu_et_al_2005} is other trending topic in the application
of SA in combination with other techniques based on natural language processing. Data mining,
more specifically mining socio-semantic networks\cite{paper:troussov:2008}, and applications 
to collaborative filtering (community detection based on tag recommendations, expertise location, etc.) are other 
potential scenarios to apply the SA theory due to the high performance and high scalability of the technique.

In particular, annotation and tagging services to gather meta-data~\cite{GelgiVD05} from the Web or 
to predict social annotation~\cite{Chen:2007:PSA:1780653.1780702,labraTagging2007},

 tagging~\cite{labraTagging2007,LabraWesoNet} or
recommendation~\cite{citeulike:3779904,gouws-vanrooyen-engelbrecht:2010:CCSR}. It has been also used in the development of 
semantic search~\cite{conf-sofsem-Suchal08,Wolverton94retrievingsemantically} engines
based on hybrid approaches~\cite{bopaEstonia,RochaSA04}, user query expansion~\cite{767402}
combining metadata and user information or improving web data annotations~\cite{GelgiVD05}.
