The validation of the algorithm depends on the configuration of the activation and spreading processes to
fit it to the different domain issues. SA is determined by the target semantic network and therefore
the defined domain knowledge (concepts and relations) is the key part to adjust its behavior. On the other
hand, taking into account that the activation and spreading is guided by the weights of relations their specification 
is fundamental to get the desired outputs. The methodology to test the implementation
of the algorithm is subjected to these conditions but a step-wise refinement method can be outlined:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Use a well-known semantic network (ontology, etc.): concepts and relations.
  \item Define a potential set of initial concepts ($\Phi$) and their initial activation value (usually $1.0$).
  \item Specify the weights of the relations to that domain knowledge.
  \item Combine the different restrictions provided by the framework.
  \item Select the degradation function.
  \item Add the reward techniques to increase the activation value of certain nodes.
  \item Try to evaluate new activation functions for their further implementation.
  \item Repeat these steps until getting the most appropriated set of output concepts to that domain knowledge.
\end{enumerate}

To apply this methodology, the Galen Ontology~\footnote{\url{http://www.opengalen.org/}} has been selected. 
It is the reference ontology in the biomedicine domain and it is widely used in reasoning and decision support processes. 
The design of the experiment depends on: the ontology, the weights of relations, the set of initial concepts, 
the set of restrictions, the degradation function and the extensions to reward nodes. The set of initial 
concepts ($\Phi$) with an initial value $1.0$ is: ``\#AdvancedBreastCancer'' and ``\#NAMEDSymptom''. The weights of the 
relations are fixed to a default value of $1.0$. The refinement of the algorithm will enable us to get
a set of output concepts similar to the process that a brain will do. The degradation functions
and the reward technique will be alternatively combined checking the output of the algorithm.
