This work provides a configurable and extensible API to support the SA technique. It allows
the configuration of restrictions and their combination to get
the most accurate set of output concepts. One of the features that
turns SA to a widely accepted algorithm lies in its flexibility 
but some disadvantages are also presented: the adjusting and refinement of
the restrictions and the weights of the relations, the selection of the
degradation function or the establishment of reward functions. This API
minimizes these advantages with an extensible framework that can be
applied to different scenarios like digital libraries in particular
biomedicine, e-procurement, e-health, etc. providing enriched services
of annotation, searching or recommendation.

The main improvement in the algorithm consists on the flexibilization of
the refinement methodology. An automatic learning algorithm to create SA configurations
according to ontologies should be developed. Thus, the training stage of SA could generate
the best configuration for a specific domain. The algorithm could optimize the selection 
of input parameters like the weights of the relations, the degradation functions 
or the combination of restrictions. Beside new mesaures related to instances such as `Cluster
Measure'', ``Specifity Measure'' or both could be used in the process of activation/spreading.
Also the selection of the next node to spread is based on a ``first
better'' strategy (if two nodes have the same activation value) because of this fact
other selection strategies should be implemented.
